Mad Planets is a multidirectional shooter released in arcades in 1983 by Gottlieb. The player controls a spaceship which can be moved and rotated independently to fend off angry planets and moons attacking from all directions. It was designed and programmed by Kan Yabumoto, with art by Jeff Lee and sound by David D. Thiel. Lee and Thiel previously worked on Q*bert for Gottlieb, a game that was inspired by a pattern of hexagons implemented by Yabumoto. Kan Yabumoto died in 2017 of a degenerative lung disease.

The player uses a flight-style joystick to move a spaceship around a dark starfield, a rotary knob to orient the ship, and a trigger on the stick to fire. At the beginning of a level, planets appear and begin growing. They can be destroyed prior to their reaching full size and sprouting moons. If a wave is completed by destroying all planets before they reach full size, a substantial bonus is awarded. Once a planet has moons, it is shielded until all its moons have been destroyed or launched at the player's ship, at which point the planet becomes angry and charges the player.

Floating astronauts appear in mini bonus rounds after every third level (every fourth after level twelve). They can be collected by flying over them. Orbiting comets accelerate the longer they go without being shot. Comets increase in value by 100 points, to a maximum of 1000, until a comet leaves the screen or the level ends
